CubeWars is a Project I been working on for a while.
The game has one map and play as a slash game RPG and tries to
intergrate many RPG systems only in a smaller scale then a 
Full on RPG. The project was made in Unity GameEngine with
scripting in C#.

To play the game go to build\CubeWars, Instructions of how to play
in the game itself(Beware, sound in the game might be loud).

When opening the project in Unity, the Library folder will be created
as Unity loads the Project, the process might take a while.

Scripts can be seen in Assets\scripts.

Enjoy
