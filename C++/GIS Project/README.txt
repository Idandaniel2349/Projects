The GIS project was a large scale project done as a part of a 
university course done in pairs, and as such it it quite large and contains many files.
I will explain the major functions of the code here and the rest can 
be read in documentation of each part of the project:

The GIS(Geographic information system), is a navigation project, that
creates maps, paths and more and then run algorhitems on the map 
such as shotrest path from point to point.

The project is split into 2 parts, each adding to the previous, 
each part has google tests that will run when running the project main
to check the fuctionality:

The GIS data is based on:
 - Coordinates: described by Longitude and Latitude
 - Entities: POI(point of intrest), Junction, Way.
 - A way is from a Junction to Junction. 

See each part for further explanations.
