In this project we are making a SphereGrid API, the main part of the project is 
in Grid.h file. 

In the project we make A sphere Grid, A Grid made from cells where
the height of each cell is the same but the width is dependent on the 
line we are in.

In the API we have the Grid class with an Inner cell class, where the 
main fuctionality of the project is(and another Line class for diffrent lines
in the Grid).

Both Cell and Grid have function of their own, See Grid.h for
the detailed documentation of each function and the API in general.

For additional info see "more-info" file.

To Run the project run the makefile and then the file created.
You will have to have googletests as my tests depend on it.
When you run the file created the tests will run.

Enjoy
